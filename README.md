# 100 Days Of Python

Hi! My name is Brent Littlefield and my goal over the summer of 2021 is to create a small python project every day for the next 100 consecuitive days.   
What I plan to get out of this challenge is to provision coding into my daily routine and to hold myself to develop something **every** day.   
My goal of this challenge I have set myself out to do is a way to keep myself accountable and to keep coding as apart of my daily routine.

I am going to work for at least an hour per day on these challenges and keep myself on track. I will keep myself accountable and make this daily effort a priority in my life.
